After the given code is executed, the values of $a and $b will both be '21'.

explanation:

Initially, $a is assigned the string value '1'.
Then, $b is assigned by reference to $a. This means $b points to the same memory location as $a. So, any changes made to $b will also affect $a.
The line $b = "2$b"; is concatenating '2' with the value of $b, which is '1' initially (since it is referencing $a). So, $b becomes '21'.
Since $b and $a are referencing the same memory location, the change made to $b also reflects in $a. Hence, $a also becomes '21'.
Therefore, after execution, both $a and $b will have the value '21'.
