1. Lifecycle in Class Components:
Class components have several lifecycle methods that are invoked at different points in the component's lifecycle. The main phases are:

Mounting:
constructor(): This is the first method called during the creation of a component. It is used for initializing state and binding event handlers.
render(): This method is responsible for rendering the component's UI based on its current state and props.
componentDidMount(): This method is called immediately after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM). It's commonly used for initiating API requests, subscribing to events, or performing other initialization tasks.
Updating:
render(): Re-renders the component's UI based on updated state or props.
componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): This method is invoked immediately after updating occurs. It's useful for performing side effects when props or state change.
Unmounting:
componentWillUnmount(): This method is called just before the component is unmounted (removed from the DOM). It's commonly used for cleanup tasks such as unsubscribing from events or canceling timers.
2. Lifecycle in Functional Components with Hooks:
Functional components with hooks have lifecycle equivalents using the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in function components.

Mounting:
useEffect(() => {}, []): This is equivalent to componentDidMount(). The callback function inside useEffect is executed after the component is rendered for the first time. The empty dependency array [] means it will only run once after the initial render, simulating the behavior of componentDidMount.
Updating:
useEffect(() => {}): This is equivalent to componentDidUpdate(). The callback function inside useEffect is executed after every render. You can conditionally execute effects based on changes in props or state by passing dependencies to the dependency array.
Unmounting:
useEffect(() => { return () => {} }, []): This is equivalent to componentWillUnmount(). The function returned from the callback function inside useEffect is executed when the component is unmounted. Returning a function from useEffect simulates cleanup tasks like unsubscribing from events or canceling timers.
